<chapter version="5.0" xml:id="working-copy">
  <title>The Working Copy</title>

  <para>The <emphasis>working copy</emphasis> is a copy of the FreeBSD
    repository documentation tree downloaded onto the local computer.
    Changes are made to the local working copy, tested, and then
    submitted as patches to be committed to the main
    repository.</para>

  <para>A full copy of the documentation tree can occupy 700 megabytes
    of disk space.  Allow for a full gigabyte of space to have room
    for temporary files and test versions of various output
    formats.</para>

  <para><link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/svn.html"><application>Subversion</application></link>
    is used to manage the FreeBSD documentation files.  It is obtained by
    installing the <application>Subversion</application>
    package:</para>

  <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>pkg install subversion</userinput></screen>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-doc-and-src">
    <title>Documentation and Manual Pages</title>

    <para>FreeBSD documentation is not just books and articles.  Manual
      pages for all the commands and configuration files are also part
      of the documentation, and part of the <acronym>FDP</acronym>'s
      territory.  Two repositories are involved:
      <literal>doc</literal> for the books and articles, and
      <literal>base</literal> for the operating system and manual
      pages.  To edit manual pages, the <literal>base</literal>
      repository must be checked out separately.</para>

    <para>Repositories may contain multiple versions of documentation
      and source code.  New modifications are almost always made only
      to the latest version, called <literal>head</literal>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-choosing-directory">
    <title>Choosing a Directory</title>

    <para>FreeBSD documentation is traditionally stored in
      <filename>/usr/doc/</filename>, and system
      source code with manual pages in
      <filename>/usr/src/</filename>.  These
      directory trees are relocatable, and users may want to put the
      working copies in other locations to avoid interfering with
      existing information in the main directories.  The examples
      that follow use <filename>~/doc</filename>
      and <filename>~/src</filename>, both
      subdirectories of the user's home directory.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-checking-out">
    <title>Checking Out a Copy</title>

    <para>A download of a working copy from the repository is called
      a <emphasis>checkout</emphasis>, and done with
      <command>svn checkout</command>.  This example checks out a
      copy of the latest version (<literal>head</literal>) of
      the main documentation tree:</para>

    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn checkout https://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/head <replaceable>~/doc</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>A checkout of the source code to work on manual pages is
      very similar:</para>

    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn checkout https://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/head <replaceable>~/src</replaceable></userinput></screen>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-updating">
    <title>Updating a Working Copy</title>

    <para>The documents and files in the FreeBSD repository change daily.
      People modify files and commit changes frequently.  Even a short
      time after an initial checkout, there will already be
      differences between the local working copy and the main FreeBSD
      repository.  To update the local version with the changes that
      have been made to the main repository, use
      <command>svn update</command> on the directory containing the
      local working copy:</para>

    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn update <replaceable>~/doc</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>Get in the protective habit of using
      <command>svn update</command> before editing document files.
      Someone else may have edited that file very recently, and the
      local working copy will not include the latest changes until it
      has been updated.  Editing the newest version of a file is much
      easier than trying to combine an older, edited local file with
      the newer version from the repository.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-revert">
    <title>Reverting Changes</title>

    <para>Sometimes it turns out that changes were
      not necessary after all, or the writer just wants to start over.
      Files can be <quote>reset</quote> to their unchanged form with
      <command>svn revert</command>.  For example, to erase the edits
      made to <filename>chapter.xml</filename> and reset it to
      unmodified form:</para>

    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn revert chapter.xml</userinput></screen>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-making-diff">
    <title>Making a Diff</title>

    <para>After edits to a file or group of files are completed, the
      differences between the local working copy and the version on
      the FreeBSD repository must be collected into a single file for
      submission.  These <emphasis>diff</emphasis> files are produced
      by redirecting the output of <command>svn diff</command> into a
      file:</para>

    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd <replaceable>~/doc</replaceable></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn diff &gt; <replaceable>doc-fix-spelling.diff</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>Give the file a meaningful name that identifies the
      contents.  The example above is for spelling fixes to the whole
      documentation tree.</para>

    <para>If the diff file is to be submitted with the web
      <quote><link xlink:href="https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi">Submit
	  a FreeBSD problem report</link></quote> interface, add a
      <filename>.txt</filename> extension to give the earnest and
      simple-minded web form a clue that the contents are plain
      text.</para>

    <para>Be careful: <command>svn diff</command> includes all changes
      made in the current directory and any subdirectories.  If there
      are files in the working copy with edits that are not ready to
      be submitted yet, provide a list of only the files that are to
      be included:</para>

    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd <replaceable>~/doc</replaceable></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn diff <replaceable>disks/chapter.xml printers/chapter.xml</replaceable> &gt; <replaceable>disks-printers.diff</replaceable></userinput></screen>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="working-copy-subversion-references">
    <title><application>Subversion</application> References</title>

    <para>These examples show very basic usage of
      <application>Subversion</application>.  More detail is available
      in the <link xlink:href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Subversion
	Book</link> and the <link xlink:href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/">Subversion

      <para>Make it easy to decide where in the tree new documentation
	should be placed.</para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  <para>In addition, the documentation tree must accommodate
    documents in many different languages and encodings.  It is
    important that the documentation tree structure does not enforce
    any particular defaults or cultural preferences.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="structure-top">
    <title>The Top Level,

	      The names are long, but by fully specifying the language
	      and encoding we prevent any future headaches when a

	  <para>Each chapter in the Handbook is stored in a file

	    attribute on the <tag>chapter</tag>
	    element.</para>

	  <para>For example, if one of the chapter files
	    contains:</para>

	  <programlisting><tag class="starttag">chapter id="kernelconfig"</tag>
...
<tag class="endtag">chapter</tag></programlisting>

	  <para>Then it will be called
	    <filename>chapter.xml</filename> in the
	    <filename>kernelconfig</filename> directory.  In general,
	    the entire contents of the chapter are in this one
	    file.</para>

	  <para>When the <acronym>XHTML</acronym> version of the
	    Handbook is produced, this will yield
	    <filename>kernelconfig.html</filename>.  This is because
	    of the <literal>id</literal> value, and is not related to
	    the name of the directory.</para>

	  <para>In earlier versions of the Handbook, the files were
	    stored in the same directory as
	    <filename>book.xml</filename>, and named after the value
	    of the <literal>id</literal> attribute on the file's
	    <tag>chapter</tag> element.  Now, it is possible to
	    include images in each chapter.  Images for each Handbook
	    chapter are stored within
	    <filename>share/images/books/handbook</filename>.  The
	    localized version of these images should be placed in the
	    same directory as the <acronym>XML</acronym> sources for
	    each chapter.  Namespace collisions are inevitable, and it
	    is easier to work with several directories with a few
	    files in them than it is to work with one directory that
	    has many files in it.</para>

	  <para>A brief look will show that there are many directories
	    with individual <filename>chapter.xml</filename> files,
	    including <filename>basics/chapter.xml</filename>,
	    <filename>introduction/chapter.xml</filename>, and
	    <filename>printing/chapter.xml</filename>.</para>

	  <important>
	    <para>Do not name chapters or directories after
	      their ordering within the Handbook.  This ordering can
	      change as the content within the Handbook is
	      reorganized.  Reorganization should be possible without
	      renaming files, unless entire chapters are being
	      promoted or demoted within the hierarchy.</para>
	  </important>

	  <para>The <filename>chapter.xml</filename> files are not
	    complete <acronym>XML</acronym> documents that can be
	    built individually.  They can only be built
	    as parts of the whole Handbook.</para>

DOC_PREFIX?= ${.CURDIR}/..

	variables <varname>SUBDIR</varname>,
	<varname>COMPAT_SYMLINK</varname>, and
	<varname>DOC_PREFIX</varname>.</para>

      <para>The <varname>SUBDIR</varname> statement and
	<varname>COMPAT_SYMLINK</varname> statement show how to
	assign a value to a variable, overriding any previous
	value.</para>

      <para>The second <varname>SUBDIR</varname> statement shows how a
	value is appended to the current value of a variable.  The
	<varname>SUBDIR</varname> variable is now <literal>articles
	  books</literal>.</para>

      <para>The <varname>DOC_PREFIX</varname> assignment shows how a
	value is assigned to the variable, but only if it is not
	already defined.  This is useful if
	<varname>DOC_PREFIX</varname> is not where this
	<filename>Makefile</filename> thinks it is - the user can
	override this and provide the correct value.</para>

      <para>What does it all mean?  <varname>SUBDIR</varname>
	mentions which subdirectories below this one the build process
	should pass any work on to.</para>

      <para><varname>COMPAT_SYMLINK</varname> is specific to
	compatibility symlinks (amazingly enough) for languages to
	their official encoding (<filename>doc/en</filename> would
	point to <filename>en_US.ISO-8859-1</filename>).</para>

      <para><varname>DOC_PREFIX</varname> is the path to the root of
	the FreeBSD Document Project tree.  This is not always that easy
	to find, and is also easily overridden, to allow for
	flexibility.  <varname>.CURDIR</varname> is a <citerefentry><refentrytitle>make</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	builtin variable with the path to the current
	directory.</para>

      <para>The final line includes the FreeBSD Documentation Project's
	project-wide <citerefentry><refentrytitle>make</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> system file

      <para>These <filename>Makefile</filename>s set <citerefentry><refentrytitle>make</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	variables that describe how to build the documentation
	contained in that directory.</para>

      <para>The <varname>MAINTAINER</varname> variable allows
	committers to claim ownership of a document in the FreeBSD
	Documentation Project, and take responsibility for maintaining
	it.</para>

      <para><varname>DOC</varname> is the name (sans the
	<filename>.xml</filename> extension) of the main document
	created by this directory.  <varname>SRCS</varname> lists all
	the individual files that make up the document.  This should
	also include important files in which a change should result
	in a rebuild.</para>

      <para><varname>FORMATS</varname> indicates the default formats
	that should be built for this document.
	<varname>INSTALL_COMPRESSED</varname> is the default list of
	compression techniques that should be used in the document
	build.  <varname>INSTALL_ONLY_COMPRESS</varname>, empty by
	default, should be non-empty if only compressed documents are
	desired in the build.</para>

      <para>The <varname>DOC_PREFIX</varname> and include statements

    <para>An actual installation of the web site is run as the

<chapter version="5.0" xml:id="xml-primer">
  <title>XML Primer</title>

  <para>Most <acronym>FDP</acronym> documentation is written with
    markup languages based on <acronym>XML</acronym>.  This chapter
    explains what that means, how to read and understand the
    documentation source, and the <acronym>XML</acronym> techniques
    used.</para>

  <para>Portions of this section were inspired by Mark Galassi's <link xlink:href="http://www.galassi.org/mark/mydocs/docbook-intro/docbook-intro.html">Get
      Going With DocBook</link>.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="xml-primer-overview">
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>In the original days of computers, electronic text was
      simple.  There were a few character sets like
      <acronym>ASCII</acronym> or <acronym>EBCDIC</acronym>, but that
      was about it.  Text was text, and what you saw really was what
      you got.  No frills, no formatting, no intelligence.</para>

    <para>Inevitably, this was not enough.  When text is in a
      machine-usable format, machines are expected to be able to use
      and manipulate it intelligently.  Authors want to indicate that
      certain phrases should be emphasized, or added to a glossary, or
      made into hyperlinks.  Filenames could be shown in a
      <quote>typewriter</quote> style font for viewing on screen, but
      as <quote>italics</quote> when printed, or any of a myriad of
      other options for presentation.</para>

    <para>It was once hoped that Artificial Intelligence (AI) would
      make this easy.  The computer would read the document and
      automatically identify key phrases, filenames, text that the
      reader should type in, examples, and more.  Unfortunately, real
      life has not happened quite like that, and computers still
      require assistance before they can meaningfully process
      text.</para>

    <para>More precisely, they need help identifying what is what.
      Consider this text:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para>To remove <filename>/tmp/foo</filename>, use
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>rm</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>

      <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>rm /tmp/foo</userinput></screen>
    </blockquote>

    <para>It is easy to see which parts are filenames, which are
      commands to be typed in, which parts are references to manual
      pages, and so on.  But the computer processing the document
      cannot.  For this we need markup.</para>

    <para><quote>Markup</quote> is commonly used to describe
      <quote>adding value</quote> or <quote>increasing cost</quote>.
      The term takes on both these meanings when applied to text.
      Markup is additional text included in the document,
      distinguished from the document's content in some way, so that
      programs that process the document can read the markup and use
      it when making decisions about the document.  Editors can hide
      the markup from the user, so the user is not distracted by
      it.</para>

    <para>The extra information stored in the markup
      <emphasis>adds value</emphasis> to the document.  Adding the
      markup to the document must typically be done by a
      person&#8212;after all, if computers could recognize the text
      sufficiently well to add the markup then there would be no need
      to add it in the first place.  This
      <emphasis>increases the cost</emphasis> (the effort required) to
      create the document.</para>

    <para>The previous example is actually represented in this
      document like this:</para>

    <programlisting><tag class="starttag">para</tag>To remove <tag class="starttag">filename</tag>/tmp/foo<tag class="endtag">filename</tag>, use &amp;man.rm.1;.<tag class="endtag">para</tag>

<tag class="starttag">screen</tag>&amp;prompt.user; <tag class="starttag">userinput</tag>rm /tmp/foo<tag class="endtag">userinput</tag><tag class="endtag">screen</tag></programlisting>

    <para>The markup is clearly separate from the content.</para>

    <para>Markup languages define what the markup means and how it
      should be interpreted.</para>

    <para>Of course, one markup language might not be enough.  A
      markup language for technical documentation has very different
      requirements than a markup language that is intended for cookery
      recipes.  This, in turn, would be very different from a markup
      language used to describe poetry.  What is really needed is a
      first language used to write these other markup languages.  A
      <emphasis>meta markup language</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>This is exactly what the eXtensible Markup
      Language (<acronym>XML</acronym>) is.  Many markup languages
      have been written in <acronym>XML</acronym>, including the two
      most used by the <acronym>FDP</acronym>,
      <acronym>XHTML</acronym> and DocBook.</para>

    <para>Each language definition is more properly called a grammar,
      vocabulary, schema or Document Type Definition
      (<acronym>DTD</acronym>).  There are various languages to
      specify an <acronym>XML</acronym> grammar, or
      <emphasis>schema</emphasis>.</para>

    <para xml:id="xml-primer-validating">A schema is a
      <emphasis>complete</emphasis> specification of all the elements
      that are allowed to appear, the order in which they should
      appear, which elements are mandatory, which are optional, and so
      forth.  This makes it possible to write an
      <acronym>XML</acronym> <emphasis>parser</emphasis> which reads
      in both the schema and a document which claims to conform to the
      schema.  The parser can then confirm whether or not all the
      elements required by the vocabulary are in the document in the
      right order, and whether there are any errors in the markup.
      This is normally referred to as
      <quote>validating the document</quote>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Validation confirms that the choice of
	elements, their ordering, and so on, conforms to that listed
	in the grammar.  It does <emphasis>not</emphasis> check
	whether <emphasis>appropriate</emphasis> markup has been used
	for the content.  If all the filenames in a document were
	marked up as function names, the parser would not flag this as
	an error (assuming, of course, that the schema defines
	elements for filenames and functions, and that they are
	allowed to appear in the same place).</para>
    </note>

    <para>Most contributions to the Documentation
      Project will be content marked up in either
      <acronym>XHTML</acronym> or DocBook, rather than alterations to
      the schemas.  For this reason, this book will not touch on how
      to write a vocabulary.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="xml-primer-elements">
    <title>Elements, Tags, and Attributes</title>

    <para>All the vocabularies written in <acronym>XML</acronym> share
      certain characteristics.  This is hardly surprising, as the
      philosophy behind <acronym>XML</acronym> will inevitably show
      through.  One of the most obvious manifestations of this
      philosophy is that of <emphasis>content</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>elements</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>Documentation, whether it is a single web page, or a lengthy
      book, is considered to consist of content.  This content is then
      divided and further subdivided into elements.  The purpose of
      adding markup is to name and identify the boundaries of these
      elements for further processing.</para>

    <para>For example, consider a typical book.  At the very top
      level, the book is itself an element.  This <quote>book</quote>
      element obviously contains chapters, which can be considered to
      be elements in their own right.  Each chapter will contain more
      elements, such as paragraphs, quotations, and footnotes.  Each
      paragraph might contain further elements, identifying content
      that was direct speech, or the name of a character in the
      story.</para>

    <para>It may be helpful to think of this as
      <quote>chunking</quote> content.  At the very top level is one
      chunk, the book.  Look a little deeper, and there are more
      chunks, the individual chapters.  These are chunked further into
      paragraphs, footnotes, character names, and so on.</para>

    <para>Notice how this differentiation between different elements
      of the content can be made without resorting to any
      <acronym>XML</acronym> terms.  It really is surprisingly
      straightforward.  This could be done with a highlighter pen and
      a printout of the book, using different colors to indicate
      different chunks of content.</para>

    <para>Of course, we do not have an electronic highlighter pen, so
      we need some other way of indicating which element each piece of
      content belongs to.  In languages written in
      <acronym>XML</acronym> (<acronym>XHTML</acronym>, DocBook, et
      al) this is done by means of <emphasis>tags</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>A tag is used to identify where a particular element starts,
      and where the element ends.  <emphasis>The tag is not part of
      the element itself</emphasis>.  Because each grammar was
      normally written to mark up specific types of information, each
      one will recognize different elements, and will therefore have
      different names for the tags.</para>

    <para>For an element called
      <replaceable>element-name</replaceable> the start tag will
      normally look like <tag class="starttag"><replaceable>element-name</replaceable></tag>.
      The corresponding closing tag for this element is <tag class="endtag"><replaceable>element-name</replaceable></tag>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using an Element (Start and End Tags)</title>

      <para><acronym>XHTML</acronym> has an element for indicating
	that the content enclosed by the element is a paragraph,
	called <tag>p</tag>.</para>

      <programlisting><tag class="starttag">p</tag>This is a paragraph.  It starts with the start tag for
  the 'p' element, and it will end with the end tag for the 'p'
  element.<tag class="endtag">p</tag>

<tag class="starttag">p</tag>This is another paragraph.  But this one is much shorter.<tag class="endtag">p</tag></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Some elements have no content.  For example, in
      <acronym>XHTML</acronym>, a horizontal line can be included in
      the document.  For these <quote>empty</quote> elements,
      <acronym>XML</acronym> introduced a shorthand form that is
      completely equivalent to the two-tag version:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using an Element Without Content</title>

      <para><acronym>XHTML</acronym> has an element for indicating a
	horizontal rule, called <tag>hr</tag>.  This element
	does not wrap content, so it looks like this:</para>

      <programlisting><tag class="starttag">p</tag>One paragraph.<tag class="endtag">p</tag>
<tag class="starttag">hr</tag><tag class="endtag">hr</tag>

<tag class="starttag">p</tag>This is another paragraph.  A horizontal rule separates this
  from the previous paragraph.<tag class="endtag">p</tag></programlisting>

      <para>The shorthand version consists of a single tag:</para>

      <programlisting><tag class="starttag">p</tag>One paragraph.<tag class="endtag">p</tag>
<tag class="emptytag">hr</tag>

<tag class="starttag">p</tag>This is another paragraph.  A horizontal rule separates this
  from the previous paragraph.<tag class="endtag">p</tag></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>As shown above, elements can contain other elements.  In the
      book example earlier, the book element contained all the chapter
      elements, which in turn contained all the paragraph elements,
      and so on.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Elements Within Elements; <tag>em</tag></title>

      <programlisting><tag class="starttag">p</tag>This is a simple <tag class="starttag">em</tag>paragraph<tag class="endtag">em</tag> where some
  of the <tag class="starttag">em</tag>words<tag class="endtag">em</tag> have been <tag class="starttag">em</tag>emphasized<tag class="endtag">em</tag>.<tag class="endtag">p</tag></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The grammar consists of rules that describe which elements
      can contain other elements, and exactly what they can
      contain.</para>

    <important>
      <para>People often confuse the terms tags and elements, and use
	the terms as if they were interchangeable.  They are
	not.</para>

      <para>An element is a conceptual part of your document.  An
	element has a defined start and end.  The tags mark where the
	element starts and ends.</para>

      <para>When this document (or anyone else knowledgeable about
	<acronym>XML</acronym>) refers to
	<quote>the <tag class="starttag">p</tag> tag</quote>
	they mean the literal text consisting of the three characters
	<literal>&lt;</literal>, <literal>p</literal>, and
	<literal>&gt;</literal>.  But the phrase
	<quote>the <tag>p</tag> element</quote> refers to the
	whole element.</para>

      <para>This distinction <emphasis>is</emphasis> very subtle.  But
	keep it in mind.</para>
    </important>

    <para>Elements can have attributes.  An attribute has a name and a
      value, and is used for adding extra information to the element.
      This might be information that indicates how the content should
      be rendered, or might be something that uniquely identifies that
      occurrence of the element, or it might be something else.</para>

    <para>An element's attributes are written
      <emphasis>inside</emphasis> the start tag for that element, and
      take the form
      <literal><replaceable>attribute-name</replaceable>="<replaceable>attribute-value</replaceable>"</literal>.</para>

    <para>In <acronym>XHTML</acronym>, the <tag>p</tag>
      element has an attribute called
      <tag class="attribute">align</tag>, which suggests an
      alignment (justification) for the paragraph to the program
      displaying the <acronym>XHTML</acronym>.</para>

    <para>The <tag class="attribute">align</tag> attribute can
      take one of four defined values, <literal>left</literal>,
      <literal>center</literal>, <literal>right</literal> and
      <literal>justify</literal>.  If the attribute is not specified
      then the default is <literal>left</literal>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using an Element with an Attribute</title>

      <programlisting><tag class="starttag">p align="left"</tag>The inclusion of the align attribute
  on this paragraph was superfluous, since the default is left.<tag class="endtag">p</tag>

<tag class="starttag">p align="center"</tag>This may appear in the center.<tag class="endtag">p</tag></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Some attributes only take specific values, such as
      <literal>left</literal> or <literal>justify</literal>.  Others
      allow any value.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Single Quotes Around Attributes</title>

      <programlisting><tag class="starttag">p align='right'</tag>I am on the right!<tag class="endtag">p</tag></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Attribute values in <acronym>XML</acronym> must be enclosed
      in either single or double quotes.  Double quotes are
      traditional.  Single quotes are useful when the attribute value
      contains double quotes.</para>

    <para>Information about attributes, elements, and tags is stored
      in catalog files.  The Documentation Project uses standard
      DocBook catalogs and includes additional catalogs for
      FreeBSD-specific features.  Paths to the catalog files are defined
      in an environment variable so they can be found by the document

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The owner of the <acronym>FPI</acronym>.</para>

	    <para>The beginning of the string identifies the owner of
	      the <acronym>FPI</acronym>.  For example, the
	      <acronym>FPI</acronym>
	      <literal>"ISO 8879:1986//ENTITIES Greek
		Symbols//EN"</literal> lists
	      <literal>ISO 8879:1986</literal> as being the owner for
	      the set of entities for Greek symbols.
	      <acronym>ISO</acronym> 8879:1986 is the International
	      Organization for Standardization
	      (<acronym>ISO</acronym>) number for the
	      <acronym>SGML</acronym> standard, the predecessor (and a
	      superset) of <acronym>XML</acronym>.</para>

	    <para>Otherwise, this string will either look like
	      <literal>-//<replaceable>Owner</replaceable></literal>
	      or
	      <literal>+//<replaceable>Owner</replaceable></literal>
	      (notice the only difference is the leading
	      <literal>+</literal> or <literal>-</literal>).</para>

	    <para>If the string starts with <literal>-</literal> then
	      the owner information is unregistered, with a
	      <literal>+</literal> identifying it as
	      registered.</para>

	    <para><acronym>ISO</acronym> 9070:1991 defines how
	      registered names are generated.  It might be derived

	      <acronym>ISO</acronym> 6523.  Additionally, a
	      registration authority could be created in order to
	      assign registered names.  The <acronym>ISO</acronym>
	      council delegated this to the American National
	      Standards Institute (<acronym>ANSI</acronym>).</para>

	    <para>Because the FreeBSD Project has not been registered,
	      the owner string is <literal>-//FreeBSD</literal>.  As seen
	      in the example, the <acronym>W3C</acronym> are not a

      <para>The syntax is slightly different:</para>

      <programlisting><tag class="starttag">!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "/path/to/file.dtd"</tag></programlisting>

      <para>The <literal>SYSTEM</literal> keyword indicates that the

	will be provided as a filename.</para>

      <para>Using <acronym>FPI</acronym>s is preferred for reasons of

    <title>Entities</title>

    <para>Entities are a mechanism for assigning names to chunks of
      content.  As an <acronym>XML</acronym> parser processes a
      document, any entities it finds are replaced by the content of
      the entity.</para>

    <para>This is a good way to have re-usable, easily changeable
      chunks of content in <acronym>XML</acronym> documents.  It is
      also the only way to include one marked up file inside another
      using <acronym>XML</acronym>.</para>

    <para>There are two types of entities for two different
      situations: <emphasis>general entities</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>parameter entities</emphasis>.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="xml-primer-general-entities">
      <title>General Entities</title>

      <para>General entities are used to assign names to reusable
	chunks of text.  These entities can only be used in the
	document.  They cannot be used in an
	<acronym>XML</acronym> context.</para>

      <para>To include the text of a general entity in the document,
	include
	<literal>&amp;<replaceable>entity-name</replaceable>;</literal>
	in the text.  For example, consider a general entity called
	<literal>current.version</literal> which expands to the
	current version number of a product.  To use it in the
	document, write:</para>

      <programlisting><tag class="starttag">para</tag>The current version of our product is
  &amp;current.version;.<tag class="endtag">para</tag></programlisting>

      <para>When the version number changes, edit the definition of
	the general entity, replacing the value.  Then reprocess the
	document.</para>

      <para>General entities can also be used to enter characters that
	could not otherwise be included in an <acronym>XML</acronym>
	document.  For example, <literal>&lt;</literal> and
	<literal>&amp;</literal> cannot normally appear in an
	<acronym>XML</acronym> document.  The <acronym>XML</acronym>
	parser sees the <literal>&lt;</literal> symbol as the start of
	a tag.  Likewise, when the <literal>&amp;</literal> symbol is
	seen, the next text is expected to be an entity name.</para>

      <para>These symbols can be included by using two predefined
	general entities: <literal>&amp;lt;</literal> and
	<literal>&amp;amp;</literal>.</para>

      <para>General entities can only be defined within an
	<acronym>XML</acronym> context.  Such definitions are usually
	done immediately after the DOCTYPE declaration.</para>

      <example>
	<title>Defining General Entities</title>

	<programlisting>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" [
&lt;!ENTITY current.version    "3.0-RELEASE"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY last.version       "2.2.7-RELEASE"&gt;
]&gt;</programlisting>

	<para>The DOCTYPE declaration has been extended by adding a
	  square bracket at the end of the first line.  The two
	  entities are then defined over the next two lines, the
	  square bracket is closed, and then the DOCTYPE declaration
	  is closed.</para>

	<para>The square brackets are necessary to indicate that the
	  DTD indicated by the DOCTYPE declaration is being
	  extended.</para>
      </example>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="xml-primer-parameter-entities">
      <title>Parameter Entities</title>

      <para>Parameter entities, like
	<link linkend="xml-primer-general-entities">general

	<link linkend="xml-primer-xml-escape">XML
	  context</link>.</para>

      <para>Parameter entity definitions are similar to those for
	general entities.  However, parameter entities are included
	with
	<literal>%<replaceable>entity-name</replaceable>;</literal>.
	The definition also includes the <literal>%</literal> between
	the <literal>ENTITY</literal> keyword and the name of the

      <para>For a mnemonic, think

	<step>
	  <para>The solution is to <emphasis>normalize</emphasis> the
	    document with an <acronym>XML</acronym> normalizer.  The
	    normalizer reads valid <acronym>XML</acronym> and writes
	    equally valid <acronym>XML</acronym> which has been
	    transformed in some way.  One way the normalizer
	    transforms the input is by expanding all the entity
	    references in the document, replacing the entities with
	    the text that they represent.</para>

	  <para><command>xmllint</command> can be used for this.  It
	    also has an option to drop the initial
	    <acronym>DTD</acronym> section so that the closing
	    <literal>]&gt;</literal> does not confuse browsers:</para>

	<note>
	  <para>When using <literal>CDATA</literal> in examples of

	<para>By itself, this is not too useful.  Text to be

	<para>It becomes more useful when controlled by

	<para>For example, suppose that documentation was produced in
	  a hard-copy version and an electronic version.  Some extra
	  text is desired in the electronic version content that was
	  not to appear in the hard-copy.</para>

	<para>Create an entity file that defines general entities to
	  include each chapter and guard these definitions with a
	  parameter entity that can be set to either
	  <literal>INCLUDE</literal> or <literal>IGNORE</literal> to
	  control whether the entity is defined.  After these
	  conditional general entity definitions, place one more
	  definition for each general entity to set them to an empty
	  value.  This technique makes use of the fact that entity
	  definitions cannot be overridden but the first definition
	  always takes effect.  So the inclusion of the chapter is
	  controlled with the corresponding parameter entity.  Set to
	  <literal>INCLUDE</literal>, the first general entity
	  definition will be read and the second one will be ignored.
	  Set to <literal>IGNORE</literal>, the first definition will
	  be ignored and the second one will take effect.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This chapter describes usage of the <acronym>XHTML</acronym>
      markup language used for the FreeBSD web site.</para>

    <para><acronym>XHTML</acronym> is the <acronym>XML</acronym>
      version of the HyperText Markup Language, the markup language of
      choice on the World Wide Web.  More information can be found at
      <uri xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</uri>.</para>

    <para><acronym>XHTML</acronym> is used to mark up pages on the
      FreeBSD web site.  It is usually not used to mark up other
      documentation, since DocBook offers a far richer set of elements
      from which to choose.  Consequently, <acronym>XHTML</acronym>
      pages will normally only be encountered when writing for the web
      site.</para>

    <para><acronym>HTML</acronym> has gone through a number of
      versions.  The <acronym>XML</acronym>-compliant version
      described here is called <acronym>XHTML</acronym>.  The latest
      widespread version is <acronym>XHTML</acronym> 1.0, available in
      both <emphasis>strict</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>transitional</emphasis> variants.</para>

    <para>The <acronym>XHTML</acronym> <acronym>DTDs</acronym> are
      available from the Ports Collection in
      <package>textproc/xhtml</package>.  They are automatically
      installed by the <package>textproc/docproj</package>
      port.</para>

    <note>
      <para>This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> an exhaustive list of
	elements, since that would just repeat the documentation for
	<acronym>XHTML</acronym>.  The aim is to list those elements
	most commonly used.  Please post questions about elements or
	uses not covered here to the <link xlink:href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-doc">FreeBSD documentation project mailing list</link>.</para>

    <note>
      <title>Inline Versus Block</title>

      <para>In the remainder of this document, when describing
	elements, <emphasis>inline</emphasis> means that the element
	can occur within a block element, and does not cause a line
	break.  A <emphasis>block</emphasis> element, by comparison,
	will cause a line break (and other processing) when it is
	encountered.</para>

    <para>An <acronym>XHTML</acronym> document is normally split into

	<para>Keep in mind that <literal>&lt;</literal> and

  <sect1 xml:id="docbook-markup-introduction">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This chapter is an introduction to DocBook as it is used for
      FreeBSD documentation.  DocBook is a large and complex markup
      system, but the subset described here covers the parts that are
      most widely used for FreeBSD documentation.  While a moderate
      subset is covered, it is impossible to anticipate every
      situation.  Please post questions that this document does
      not answer to the <link xlink:href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-doc">FreeBSD documentation project mailing list</link>.</para>

    <para>DocBook was originally developed by HaL Computer Systems and
      O'Reilly &amp; Associates to be a Document Type Definition
      (<acronym>DTD</acronym>) for writing technical documentation
      <footnote><para>A short history can be found under <link xlink:href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/intro.shtml#d0e41">http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/intro.shtml#d0e41</link>.</para></footnote>.
      Since 1998 it is maintained by the <link xlink:href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=docbook">
	DocBook Technical Committee</link>.  As such, and unlike
      LinuxDoc and <acronym>XHTML</acronym>, DocBook is very heavily
      oriented towards markup that describes <emphasis>what</emphasis>
      something is, rather than describing <emphasis>how</emphasis> it
      should be presented.</para>

    <para>The DocBook <acronym>DTD</acronym> is available from the
      Ports Collection in the
      <package>textproc/docbook-xml</package>
      port.  It is automatically installed as part of the
      <package>textproc/docproj</package>
      port.</para>

    <note>
      <title>Formal Versus Informal</title>

      <para>Some elements may exist in two forms,
	<emphasis>formal</emphasis> and <emphasis>informal</emphasis>.
	Typically, the formal version of the element will consist of a
	title followed by the informal version of the element.  The
	informal version will not have a title.</para>
    </note>

    <note>
      <title>Inline Versus Block</title>

      <para>In the remainder of this document, when describing
	elements, <emphasis>inline</emphasis> means that the element
	can occur within a block element, and does not cause a line
	break.  A <emphasis>block</emphasis> element, by comparison,
	will cause a line break (and other processing) when it is
	encountered.</para>
    </note>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="docbook-markup-freebsd-extensions">
    <title>FreeBSD Extensions</title>

    <para>The FreeBSD Documentation Project has extended the DocBook
      <acronym>DTD</acronym> with additional elements and entities.
      These additions serve to make some of the markup easier or more
      precise.</para>

    <para>Throughout the rest of this document, the term
      <quote>DocBook</quote> is used to mean the FreeBSD-extended
      DocBook <acronym>DTD</acronym>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Most of these extensions are not unique to FreeBSD, it was
	just felt that they were useful enhancements for this

  <sect1 xml:id="docbook-markup-document-structure">
    <title>Document Structure</title>

    <para>DocBook allows structuring documentation in several ways.
      The FreeBSD Documentation Project uses two primary types of DocBook
      document: the book and the article.</para>

    <para>Books are organized into <tag>chapter</tag>s.
      This is a mandatory requirement.  There may be
      <tag>part</tag>s between the book and the chapter to
      provide another layer of organization.  For example, the
      Handbook is arranged in this way.</para>

    <para>A chapter may (or may not) contain one or more sections.
      These are indicated with the <tag>sect1</tag> element.
      If a section contains another section then use the
      <tag>sect2</tag> element, and so on, up to
      <tag>sect5</tag>.</para>

    <para>Chapters and sections contain the remainder of the
      content.</para>

    <para>An article is simpler than a book, and does not use
      chapters.  Instead, the content of an article is organized into
      one or more sections, using the same <tag>sect1</tag>
      (and <tag>sect2</tag> and so on) elements that are used
      in books.</para>

    <para>The nature of the document being written should be used to
      determine whether it is best marked up as a book or an article.
      Articles are well suited to information that does not need to be
      broken down into several chapters, and that is, relatively
      speaking, quite short, at up to 20-25 pages of content.  Books
      are best suited to information that can be broken up into
      several chapters, possibly with appendices and similar content
      as well.</para>

    <para>The <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/docs.html">FreeBSD
	tutorials</link> are all marked up as articles, while this
      document, the <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/index.html">FAQ</link>, and the
      <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html">Handbook</link>
      are all marked up as books, for example.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="docbook-markup-starting-a-book">
      <title>Starting a Book</title>

      <para>The content of a book is contained within the
	<tag>book</tag> element.  As well as containing
	structural markup, this element can contain elements that
	include additional information about the book.  This is either
	meta-information, used for reference purposes, or additional
	content used to produce a title page.</para>

      <para>This additional information is contained within
	<tag>info</tag>.</para>

      <title>Applications, Commands, Options, and Cites</title>

      <para>Both applications and commands are frequently referred to
	when writing documentation.  The distinction between them is
	that an application is the name of a program or suite of
	programs that fulfill a particular task.  A command is the
	filename of a program that the user can type and run at a
	command line.</para>

      <para>It is often necessary to show some of the options that a
	command might take.</para>

      <para>Finally, it is often useful to list a command with its
	manual section number, in the <quote>command(number)</quote>
	format so common in Unix manuals.</para>

      <para>Mark up application names with
	<tag>application</tag>.</para>

      <para>To list a command with its manual section
	number (which should be most of the time) the DocBook
	element is <tag>citerefentry</tag>.  This will
	contain a further two elements,
	<tag>refentrytitle</tag> and
	<tag>manvolnum</tag>.  The content of
	<tag>refentrytitle</tag> is the name of the command,
	and the content of <tag>manvolnum</tag> is the
	manual page section.</para>

      <para>This can be cumbersome to write, and so a series of
	<link linkend="xml-primer-general-entities">general
	  entities</link> have been created to make this easier.
	Each entity takes the form
	<literal>&amp;man.<replaceable>manual-page</replaceable>.<replaceable>manual-section</replaceable>;</literal>.</para>

      <para>The file that contains these entities is in
	<filename>doc/share/xml/man-refs.ent</filename>, and can be
	referred to using this <acronym>FPI</acronym>:</para>

      <programlisting>PUBLIC "-//FreeBSD//ENTITIES DocBook Manual Page Entities//EN"</programlisting>

      <para>Therefore, the introduction to FreeBSD documentation will

&lt;!ENTITY % man PUBLIC "-//FreeBSD//ENTITIES DocBook Manual Page Entities//EN"&gt;

      <para>Use <tag>command</tag> to include a command

	user should type.</para>

      <para>Use <tag>option</tag> to mark up the options
	which will be passed to a command.</para>

      <para>When referring to the same command multiple times in
	close proximity, it is preferred to use the
	<literal>&amp;man.<replaceable>command</replaceable>.<replaceable>section</replaceable>;</literal>
	notation to markup the first reference and use
	<tag>command</tag> to markup subsequent references.
	This makes the generated output, especially

    <sect2 xml:id="docbook-markup-links-ids">
      <title><literal>xml:id</literal> Attributes</title>

      <para>Most DocBook elements accept an <literal>xml:id</literal>
	attribute to give that part of the document a unique name.
	The <literal>xml:id</literal> can be used as a target for a
	crossreference or link.</para>

      <para>Any portion of the document that will be a link target
	must have an <literal>xml:id</literal> attribute.  Assigning
	an <literal>xml:id</literal> to all chapters and sections,
	even if there are no current plans to link to them, is a good
	idea.  These <literal>xml:id</literal>s can be used as unique
	reference points by anyone referring to the
	<acronym>HTML</acronym> version of the document.</para>

      <example>
	<title><literal>xml:id</literal> on Chapters and
	  Sections Example</title>

	<programlisting><tag class="starttag">chapter xml:id="introduction"</tag>
  <tag class="starttag">title</tag>Introduction<tag class="endtag">title</tag>

  <tag class="starttag">para</tag>This is the introduction.  It contains a subsection,
    which is identified as well.<tag class="endtag">para</tag>

  <tag class="endtag">sect1</tag>
<tag class="endtag">chapter</tag></programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>Use descriptive values for <literal>xml:id</literal>
	names.  The values must be unique within the entire document,
	not just in a single file.  In the example, the subsection
	<literal>xml:id</literal> is constructed by appending text to
	the chapter <literal>xml:id</literal>.  This ensures that the
	<literal>xml:id</literal>s are unique.  It also helps both
	reader and anyone editing the document to see where the link
	is located within the document, similar to a directory path to
	a file.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="docbook-markup-links-crossreferences">
      <title>Crossreferences with <literal>xref</literal></title>

      <para><tag>xref</tag> provides the reader with a link to jump to
	another section of the document.  The target
	<literal>xml:id</literal> is specified in the
	<literal>linkend</literal> attribute, and <tag>xref</tag>
	generates the link text automatically.</para>

      <title>Linking to Other Documents on the

      <para>The link element described here allows the writer to
	define the link text.  When link text is used, it is very
	important to be descriptive to give the reader an idea of
	where the link goes.  Remember that DocBook can be rendered to
	multiple types of media.  The reader might be looking at a
	printed book or other form of media where there are no links.
	If the link text is not descriptive enough, the reader might
	not be able to locate the linked section.</para>

      <para>The <literal>xlink:href</literal> attribute is the
	<acronym>URL</acronym> of the page, and the content of the
	element is the text that will be displayed for the user to
	activate.</para>

      <para>In many situations, it is preferable to show the actual
	<acronym>URL</acronym> rather than text.  This can be done by
	leaving out the element text entirely.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><tag>link</tag> to a FreeBSD Documentation Web
	    Page Example</title>

	  <para>Link to the book or article <acronym>URL</acronym>
	    entity.  To link to a specific chapter in a book, add a
	    slash and the chapter file name, followed by an optional
	    anchor within the chapter.  For articles, link to the
	    article <acronym>URL</acronym> entity, followed by an
	    optional anchor within the article.
	    <acronym>URL</acronym> entities can be found in

<chapter version="5.0" xml:id="translations">
  <title>Translations</title>

  <para>This is the FAQ for people translating the FreeBSD
    documentation (FAQ, Handbook, tutorials, manual pages, and others)
    to different languages.</para>

  <para>It is <emphasis>very</emphasis> heavily based on the
    translation FAQ from the FreeBSD German Documentation Project,
    originally written by Frank Gründer
    <email>elwood@mc5sys.in-berlin.de</email> and translated back to
    English by Bernd Warken <email>bwarken@mayn.de</email>.</para>

  <para>The FAQ is maintained by the Documentation Engineering Team <email>doceng@FreeBSD.org</email>.</para>

  <qandaset>
    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>What do <phrase>i18n</phrase> and <phrase>l10n</phrase>
	  mean?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para><phrase>i18n</phrase> means
	  <phrase>internationalization</phrase> and
	  <phrase>l10n</phrase> means <phrase>localization</phrase>.
	  They are just a convenient shorthand.</para>

	<para><phrase>i18n</phrase> can be read as <quote>i</quote>
	  followed by 18 letters, followed by <quote>n</quote>.
	  Similarly, <phrase>l10n</phrase> is <quote>l</quote>
	  followed by 10 letters, followed by <quote>n</quote>.</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>Is there a mailing list for translators?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>Yes.  Different translation groups have their own
	  mailing lists.  The <link xlink:href="https://www.freebsd.org/docproj/translations.html">list
	    of translation projects</link> has more information about
	  the mailing lists and web sites run by each translation
	  project.  In addition there is
	  <email>freebsd-translators@freebsd.org</email> for general
	  translation discussion.</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>Are more translators needed?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>Yes.  The more people work on translation the faster it
	  gets done, and the faster changes to the English
	  documentation are mirrored in the translated
	  documents.</para>

	<para>You do not have to be a professional translator to be
	  able to help.</para>

    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>What languages do I need to know?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>Ideally, you will have a good knowledge of written
	  English, and obviously you will need to be fluent in the
	  language you are translating to.</para>

	<para>English is not strictly necessary.  For example, you
	  could do a Hungarian translation of the FAQ from the Spanish
	  translation.</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>What software do I need to know?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>It is strongly recommended that you maintain a local
	  copy of the FreeBSD Subversion repository (at least the
	  documentation part).  This can be done by running:</para>

	<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn checkout https://svn.FreeBSD.org/doc/head/ head</userinput></screen>

	<para><link xlink:href="https://svn.FreeBSD.org/">svn.FreeBSD.org</link>
	  is a public <literal>SVN</literal> server.  Verify the
	  server certificate from the list of <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/svn.html#svn-mirrors">Subversion
	    mirror sites</link>.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>This will require the
	    <package>devel/subversion</package> package to be
	    installed.</para>
	</note>

	<para>You should be comfortable using
	  <application>svn</application>.  This will allow you to see
	  what has changed between different versions of the files
	  that make up the documentation.</para>

	<para>For example, to view the differences between revisions
	  <literal>r33733</literal> and <literal>r33734</literal> of
	  <filename>en_US.ISO8859-1/books/fdp-primer/book.xml</filename>,
	  run:</para>

	<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn diff -r<replaceable>33733</replaceable>:<replaceable>33734</replaceable> en_US.ISO8859-1/books/fdp-primer/book.xml</userinput></screen>

	<para>Please see the complete explanation of using
	  <application>Subversion</application> in FreeBSD in the <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/svn.html">FreeBSD
	    Handbook</link>.</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>How do I find out who else might be translating to the
	  same language?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>The <link xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/docproj/translations.html">Documentation
	    Project translations page</link> lists the translation
	  efforts that are currently known about.  If others are
	  already working on translating documentation to your
	  language, please do not duplicate their efforts.  Instead,
	  contact them to see how you can help.</para>

	<para>If no one is listed on that page as translating for your
	  language, then send a message to the <link xlink:href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-doc">FreeBSD documentation project mailing list</link> in case someone
	  else is thinking of doing a translation, but has not
	  announced it yet.</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>No one else is translating to my language.  What do I
	  do?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>Congratulations, you have just started the
	  <quote>FreeBSD <replaceable>your-language-here</replaceable>
	  Documentation Translation Project</quote>.  Welcome
	  aboard.</para>

	<para>First, decide whether or not you have got the time to
	  spare.  Since you are the only person working on your
	  language at the moment it is going to be your responsibility
	  to publicize your work and coordinate any volunteers that
	  might want to help you.</para>

	<para>Write an email to the Documentation Project mailing
	  list, announcing that you are going to translate the
	  documentation, so the Documentation Project translations
	  page can be maintained.</para>

	<para>If there is already someone in your country providing
	  FreeBSD mirroring services you should contact them and ask
	  if you can have some webspace for your project, and possibly
	  an email address or mailing list services.</para>

	<para>Then pick a document and start translating.  It is best
	  to start with something fairly small&#8212;either the FAQ,
	  or one of the tutorials.</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>I have translated some documentation, where do I send
	  it?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>That depends.  If you are already working with a
	  translation team (such as the Japanese team, or the German
	  team) then they will have their own procedures for handling
	  submitted documentation, and these will be outlined on their
	  web pages.</para>

	<para>If you are the only person working on a particular
	  language (or you are responsible for a translation project
	  and want to submit your changes back to the FreeBSD project)
	  then you should send your translation to the FreeBSD project
	  (see the next question).</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>I am the only person working on translating to this
	  language, how do I submit my translation?</para>

	<para>or</para>

	<para>We are a translation team, and want to submit
	  documentation that our members have translated for
	  us.</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>First, make sure your translation is organized properly.
	  This means that it should drop into the existing
	  documentation tree and build straight away.</para>

	<para>Currently, the FreeBSD documentation is stored in a top
	  level directory called <filename>head/</filename>.
	  Directories below this are named according to the language
	  code they are written in, as defined in ISO639
	  (<filename>/usr/share/misc/iso639</filename> on a version of
	  FreeBSD newer than 20th January 1999).</para>

	<para>If your language can be encoded in different ways (for
	  example, Chinese) then there should be directories below
	  this, one for each encoding format you have provided.</para>

	<para>Finally, you should have directories for each
	  document.</para>

	<para>For example, a hypothetical Swedish translation might
	  look like:</para>

	<programlisting>head/
    sv_SE.ISO8859-1/
                     Makefile

	  If you do not have access to your own webspace (perhaps your

	<para>Either way, you should use Bugzilla to submit a

      <question>
	<para>Can I include language or country specific text in my
	  translation?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>We would prefer that you did not.</para>

	<para>For example, suppose that you are translating the
	  Handbook to Korean, and want to include a section about
	  retailers in Korea in your Handbook.</para>

	<para>There is no real reason why that information should not
	  be in the English (or German, or Spanish, or Japanese, or
	  &#8230;) versions as well.  It is feasible that an English
	  speaker in Korea might try to pick up a copy of FreeBSD
	  whilst over there.  It also helps increase FreeBSD's
	  perceived presence around the globe, which is not a bad
	  thing.</para>

	<para>If you have country specific information, please submit
	  it as a change to the English Handbook (using
	  Bugzilla) and then translate the change back to your
	  language in the translated Handbook.</para>

	<para>Thanks.</para>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>How should language specific characters be
	  included?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>Non-ASCII characters in the documentation should be
	  included using SGML entities.</para>

	<para>Briefly, these look like an ampersand (&amp;), the name
	  of the entity, and a semi-colon (;).</para>

	<para>The entity names are defined in ISO8879, which is in the
	  ports tree as <package>textproc/iso8879</package>.</para>

	<para>A few examples include:</para>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>Addressing the reader</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>In the English documents, the reader is addressed as
	  <quote>you</quote>, there is no formal/informal distinction
	  as there is in some languages.</para>

	<para>If you are translating to a language which does
	  distinguish, use whichever form is typically used in other
	  technical documentation in your language.  If in doubt, use
	  a mildly polite form.</para>
      </answer>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>Do I need to include any additional information in my
	  translations?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>Yes.</para>

	<para>The header of the English version of each document will
	  look something like this:</para>

--&gt;</programlisting>

	<para>The exact boilerplate may change, but it will always
	  include a $FreeBSD$ line and the phrase
	  <literal>The FreeBSD Documentation Project</literal>.
	  Note that the $FreeBSD part is expanded automatically
	  by Subversion, so it should be empty (just
	  <literal>$FreeBSD$</literal>) for new
	  files.</para>

	<para>Your translated documents should include their own
	  $FreeBSD$ line, and change the
	  <literal>FreeBSD Documentation Project</literal> line to
	  <literal>The FreeBSD <replaceable>language</replaceable>
	    Documentation Project</literal>.</para>

	<para>In addition, you should add a third line which indicates

    <para>The <link xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/"><acronym>GNU</acronym>

      translators an easy way to create and maintain translations of
      documents.  Translatable strings are extracted from the original
      document into a <acronym>PO</acronym> (Portable Object) file.
      Translated versions of the strings are entered with a separate

    <para>The translations are in subdirectories of the main
      documentation directory, here assumed to be
      <filename>~/doc/</filename> as shown in
      <xref linkend="overview-quick-start"/>.  For example, German
      translations are located in
      <filename>~/doc/de_DE.ISO8859-1/</filename>, and French
      translations are in
      <filename>~/doc/fr_FR.ISO8859-1/</filename>.</para>

    <para>Each language directory contains separate subdirectories
      named for the type of documents, usually
      <filename>articles/</filename> and
      <filename>books/</filename>.</para>

    <para>Combining these directory names gives the complete path to
      an article or book.  For example, the French translation of the
      NanoBSD article is in
      <filename>~/doc/fr_FR.ISO8859-1/articles/nanobsd/</filename>,
      and the Mongolian translation of the Handbook is in
      <filename>~/doc/mn_MN.UTF-8/books/handbook/</filename>.</para>

    <para>A new language directory must be created when translating
      a document to a new language.  If the language directory already
      exists, only a subdirectory in the
      <filename>articles/</filename> or <filename>books/</filename>
      directory is needed.</para>

    <para>FreeBSD documentation builds are controlled by a
      <filename>Makefile</filename> in the same directory.  With
      simple articles, the <filename>Makefile</filename> can often
      just be copied verbatim from the original English directory.
      The translation process combines multiple separate
      <filename>book.xml</filename> and
      <filename>chapter.xml</filename> files in books into a single
      file, so the <filename>Makefile</filename> for book translations
      must be copied and modified.</para>

    <title>Translating</title>

    <para>The <application>gettext</application> system greatly
      reduces the number of things that must be tracked by a
      translator.  Strings to be translated are extracted from the

      <acronym>PO</acronym> editor is used to enter the translated
      versions of each string.</para>

    <para>The FreeBSD <acronym>PO</acronym> translation system does not

      can be run at any time to update the <acronym>PO</acronym>
      file.</para>

    <para>A <acronym>PO</acronym> editor is used to edit the file.
      <package role="port">editors/poedit</package> is shown in
      these examples because it is simple and has minimal

      features to make the job of translating easier.  The Ports

    <title>Markup</title>

    <para>Various markup forms and rendering programs have been used
      for manual pages.  FreeBSD has used <citerefentry><refentrytitle>groff</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry> and the newer
      <citerefentry><refentrytitle>mandoc</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.  Most existing FreeBSD manual pages, and all new
      ones, use the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>mdoc</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry> form of markup.  This is a simple
      line-based markup that is reasonably expressive.  It is mostly
      semantic: parts of text are marked up for what they are, rather
      than for how they should appear when rendered.  There is some
      appearance-based markup which is usually best avoided.</para>

    <para>Manual page source is usually interpreted and displayed to

	clarity and consistency, the FreeBSD Documentation project adds

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Only the first letter of macros is upper case</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Always use upper case for the first letter of a

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Update <literal>.Dd</literal> when making non-trivial
	    changes to a manual page</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The <emphasis>Document date</emphasis> informs the
	      reader about the last time the manual page was updated.
	      It is important to update whenever non-trivial changes
	      are made to the manual pages.  Trivial changes like
	      spelling or punctuation fixes that do not affect usage
	      can be made without updating
	      <literal>.Dd</literal>.</para>
	  </listitem>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Give examples</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Show the reader examples when possible.  Even
	      trivial examples are valuable, because what is trivial
	      to the writer is not necessarily trivial to the reader.
	      Three examples are a good goal.  A trivial example shows
	      the minimal requirements, a serious example shows actual
	      use, and an in-depth example demonstrates unusual or
	      non-obvious functionality.</para>

      <para>Note how the commas at the end of the

	The <literal>.Xr</literal> macro expects two parameters to
	follow it, the name of an external manual page, and a section
	number.  The space separates the punctuation from the section
	number.  Without the space, the external links would

    <title>Tips</title>

    <para>Technical documentation can be improved by consistent use of
      several principles.  Most of these can be classified into three
      goals: <emphasis>be clear</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>be complete</emphasis>, and
      <emphasis>be concise</emphasis>.  These goals can conflict with
      each other.  Good writing consists of a balance between
      them.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="writing-style-be-clear">
      <title>Be Clear</title>

      <para>Clarity is extremely important.  The reader may be a
	novice, or reading the document in a second language.  Strive
	for simple, uncomplicated text that clearly explains the
	concepts.</para>

      <para>Avoid flowery or embellished speech, jokes, or colloquial
	expressions.  Write as simply and clearly as possible.  Simple
	text is easier to understand and translate.</para>

      <para>Keep explanations as short, simple, and clear as possible.
	Avoid empty phrases like <quote>in order to</quote>, which
	usually just means <quote>to</quote>.  Avoid potentially
	patronizing words like <quote>basically</quote>.  Avoid Latin
	terms like <quote>i.e.,</quote> or <quote>cf.</quote>, which
	may be unknown outside of academic or scientific
	groups.</para>

      <para>Write in a formal style.  Avoid addressing the reader
	as <quote>you</quote>.  For example, say
	<quote>copy the file to <filename>/tmp</filename></quote>
	rather than <quote>you can copy the file to
	  <filename>/tmp</filename></quote>.</para>

      <para>Give clear, correct, <emphasis>tested</emphasis> examples.
	A trivial example is better than no example.  A good example
	is better yet.  Do not give bad examples, identifiable by
	apologies or sentences like <quote>but really it should never
	  be done that way</quote>.  Bad examples are worse than no
	examples.  Give good examples, because <emphasis>even when
	  warned not to use the example as shown</emphasis>, the
	reader will usually just use the example as shown.</para>

      <para>Avoid <emphasis>weasel words</emphasis> like
	<quote>should</quote>, <quote>might</quote>,
	<quote>try</quote>, or <quote>could</quote>.  These words
	imply that the speaker is unsure of the facts, and
	create doubt in the reader.</para>

      <para>Similarly, give instructions as imperative commands: not
	<quote>you should do this</quote>, but merely
	<quote>do this</quote>.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="writing-style-be-complete">
      <title>Be Complete</title>

      <para>Do not make assumptions about the reader's abilities or
	skill level.  Tell them what they need to know.  Give links to
	other documents to provide background information without
	having to recreate it.  Put yourself in the reader's place,
	anticipate the questions they will ask, and answer
	them.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="writing-style-be-concise">
      <title>Be Concise</title>

      <para>While features should be documented completely, sometimes
	there is so much information that the reader cannot easily
	find the specific detail needed.  The balance between being
	complete and being concise is a challenge.  One approach is to
	have an introduction, then a <quote>quick start</quote>
	section that describes the most common situation, followed by
	an in-depth reference section.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="writing-style-guidelines">
    <title>Guidelines</title>

    <para>To promote consistency between the myriad authors of the
      FreeBSD documentation, some guidelines have been drawn up for
      authors to follow.</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>Use American English Spelling</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>There are several variants of English, with different
	    spellings for the same word.  Where spellings differ, use
	    the American English variant.  <quote>color</quote>, not
	    <quote>colour</quote>, <quote>rationalize</quote>, not
	    <quote>rationalise</quote>, and so on.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>The use of British English may be accepted in the
	      case of a contributed article, however the spelling must
	      be consistent within the whole document.  The other
	      documents such as books, web site, manual pages, etc.
	      will have to use American English.</para>
	  </note>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Do not use contractions</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Do not use contractions.  Always spell the phrase out
	    in full.  <quote>Don't use contractions</quote> is
	    wrong.</para>

	  <para>Avoiding contractions makes for a more formal tone, is
	    more precise, and is slightly easier for
	    translators.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Use the serial comma</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>In a list of items within a paragraph, separate each
	    item from the others with a comma.  Separate the last item
	    from the others with a comma and the word
	    <quote>and</quote>.</para>

	  <para>For example:</para>

	  <blockquote>
	    <para>This is a list of one, two and three items.</para>
	  </blockquote>

	  <para>Is this a list of three items, <quote>one</quote>,
	    <quote>two</quote>, and <quote>three</quote>, or a list of
	    two items, <quote>one</quote> and <quote>two and
	      three</quote>?</para>

	  <para>It is better to be explicit and include a serial
	    comma:</para>

	  <blockquote>
	    <para>This is a list of one, two, and three items.</para>
	  </blockquote>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Avoid redundant phrases</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Do not use redundant phrases.  In particular,
	    <quote>the command</quote>, <quote>the file</quote>, and
	    <quote>man command</quote> are often redundant.</para>

	  <para>For example, commands:</para>

	  <informalexample>
	    <para>Wrong: Use the <command>svn</command> command to
	      update sources.</para>
	  </informalexample>

	  <informalexample>
	    <para>Right:  Use <command>svn</command> to update
	      sources.</para>
	  </informalexample>

	  <para>Filenames:</para>

	  <informalexample>
	    <para>Wrong:  &#8230; in the filename
	      <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename>&#8230;</para>
	  </informalexample>

	  <informalexample>
	    <para>Right:  &#8230; in
	      <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename>&#8230;</para>
	  </informalexample>

	  <para>Manual page references (the second example uses
	    <tag>citerefentry</tag> with the
	    <literal>&amp;man.csh.1;</literal> entity):.</para>

	  <informalexample>
	    <para>Wrong:  See <command>man csh</command> for more
	      information.</para>
	  </informalexample>

	  <informalexample>
	    <para>Right:  See <citerefentry><refentrytitle>csh</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>
	  </informalexample>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Two spaces between sentences</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Always use two spaces between sentences, as it
	    improves readability and eases use of tools such as
	    <application>Emacs</application>.</para>

	  <para>A period and spaces followed by a capital letter
	    does not always mark a new sentence, especially in names.
	    <quote>Jordan K. Hubbard</quote> is a good example.  It
	    has a capital <literal>H</literal> following a period and
	    a space, and is certainly not a new sentence.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    <sect2 xml:id="writing-style-acronyms">
      <title>Acronyms</title>

      <para>Acronyms should be defined the first time they appear in a
	document, as in:
	<quote>Network Time Protocol (<acronym>NTP</acronym>)</quote>.
	After the acronym has been defined, use the acronym alone
	unless it makes more sense contextually to use the whole term.
	Acronyms are usually defined only once per chapter or per
	document.</para>

      <para>All acronyms should be enclosed in
	<tag>acronym</tag> tags.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="writing-style-indentation">
      <title>Indentation</title>

      <para>The first line in each file starts with no indentation,
	<emphasis>regardless</emphasis> of the indentation level of
	the file which might contain the current file.</para>

      <para>Opening tags increase the indentation level by two spaces.
	Closing tags decrease the indentation level by two spaces.
	Blocks of eight spaces at the start of a line should be
	replaced with a tab.  Do not use spaces in front of tabs, and
	do not add extraneous whitespace at the end of a line.
	Content within elements should be indented by two spaces if
	the content runs over more than one line.</para>

      <para>For example, the source for this section looks like
	this:</para>

      <programlisting><tag class="starttag">chapter</tag>
  <tag class="starttag">title</tag>...<tag class="endtag">title</tag>

  <tag class="starttag">sect1</tag>
    <tag class="starttag">title</tag>...<tag class="endtag">title</tag>

    <tag class="starttag">sect2</tag>
      <tag class="starttag">title</tag>Indentation<tag class="endtag">title</tag>

      <tag class="starttag">para</tag>The first line in each file starts with no indentation,
	<tag class="starttag">emphasis</tag>regardless<tag class="endtag">emphasis</tag> of the indentation level of
	the file which might contain the current file.<tag class="endtag">para</tag>

      ...
    <tag class="endtag">sect2</tag>
  <tag class="endtag">sect1</tag>
<tag class="endtag">chapter</tag></programlisting>

      <para>Tags containing long attributes follow the same
	rules.  Following the indentation rules in this case helps
	editors and writers see which content is inside the
	tags:</para>

      <programlisting><tag class="starttag">para</tag>See the <tag class="starttag">link
    linkend="gmirror-troubleshooting"</tag>Troubleshooting<tag class="endtag">link</tag>
  section if there are problems booting.  Powering down and
  disconnecting the original <tag class="starttag">filename</tag>ada0<tag class="endtag">filename</tag> disk
  will allow it to be kept as an offline backup.<tag class="endtag">para</tag>

<tag class="starttag">para</tag>It is also possible to journal the boot disk of a &amp;os;
  system.  Refer to the article <tag class="starttag">link
    xlink:href="&amp;url.articles.gjournal-desktop;"</tag>Implementing UFS
    Journaling on a Desktop PC<tag class="endtag">link</tag> for detailed
  instructions.<tag class="endtag">para</tag></programlisting>

      <para>When an element is too long to fit on the remainder of a
	line without wrapping, moving the start tag to the next line
	can make the source easier to read.  In this example, the
	<literal>systemitem</literal> element has been moved to the
	next line to avoid wrapping and indenting:</para>

      <programlisting><tag class="starttag">para</tag>With file flags, even
  <tag class="starttag">systemitem class="username"</tag>root<tag class="endtag">systemitem</tag> can be
  prevented from removing or altering files.<tag class="endtag">para</tag></programlisting>

	these guidelines can be found in

      <sect3 xml:id="writing-style-tag-style-separating">
	<title>Separating Tags</title>

	<para>Tags like <tag>itemizedlist</tag> which will

	  take character data themselves, are always on a line by
	  themselves.</para>

	<para>Tags like <tag>para</tag> and
	  <tag>term</tag> do not need other tags to contain
	  normal character data, and their contents begin immediately
	  after the tag, <emphasis>on the same line</emphasis>.</para>

	<para>The same applies to when these two types of tags
	  close.</para>

	<para>This leads to an obvious problem when mixing these
	  tags.</para>

	<para>When a starting tag which cannot contain character data
	  directly follows a tag of the type that requires other tags
	  within it to use character data, they are on separate lines.
	  The second tag should be properly indented.</para>

	<para>When a tag which can contain character data closes
	  directly after a tag which cannot contain character data
	  closes, they co-exist on the same line.</para>

      <title>Whitespace Changes</title>

      <para><emphasis>Do not commit changes
	  to content at the same time as changes to
	  formatting</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>When content and whitespace changes are kept separate,
	translation teams can easily see whether a change was content
	that must be translated or only whitespace.</para>

      <para>For example, if two sentences have been added to a
	paragraph so that the line lengths now go
	over 80 columns, first commit the change with the too-long
	lines.  Then fix the line wrapping, and commit this
	second change.  In the commit message for the second change,
	indicate that this is a whitespace-only change that can be
	ignored by translators.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="writing-style-nonbreaking-space">
      <title>Non-Breaking Space</title>

      <para>Avoid line breaks in places where they look ugly or make
	it difficult to follow a sentence.  Line breaks depend on the
	width of the chosen output medium.  In particular, viewing the
	HTML documentation with a text browser can lead to badly
	formatted paragraphs like the next one:</para>
